# Vending Machine Kata - Felipe Santos

Node.js/TypeScript technical Kata.

## Important Notes

I've built this to follow Dependency Injection and Microservices principles within an MVC pattern.

My initial plan was to build a static model, business service logic and its routes for the controller layer to handle user requests from a simple Vue.js interface.

- backend
  - routes
  - services
  - models

- frontend
  - user inputs
  - HTTP requests

But here I'm focusing mainly on the models and services layer and TDD programming to test business requirements.
