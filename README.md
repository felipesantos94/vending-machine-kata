# Vending Machine Kata - Felipe Santos

Node.js/TypeScript technical test for Keyprod.

## Important Notes

I've build this to following a Dependecy Injection and Microservices principles within an MVC pattern.

My initial plan was was to build a static model, business service logic, and a controller layer to handle user requests from a simple Vue.js interface.

--backend
  --routes
  --services
  --models

--frontend
  --user inputs
  --http requests

But here I'm focusing mainly on the models and services layer and TDD programing to test business requirements.
